The materials you will need are one 10 to 12-inch skillet, 1 saucepan, 1 chef\'s knife, and a bowl or wire mesh strainer to rinse the rice.",
        "Rinse the rice in the strainer or bowl until the water runs clear, then drain off the excess water. Remove the skin from the onion and garlic cloves, then quarter and dice the onion. Press the garlic in a garlic press, or alternately, chop it up finely. Wash the tomatoes, cut them into quarters, and then dice them into small chunks. ",
        "Add the olive oil to the skillet and heat to medium heat. Add the onions and stir occasionally for about 4 minutes or until they become translucent. Next add in the garlic, tomatoes, salt, pepper, and saffron. Let this mixture simmer on medium heat until it reduces in volume, approximately 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the rice to the skillet and stir to coat. ",
        "Add the chicken or vegetable stock to a saucepan and bring to a boil. Then add in the rice mixture and stir once to combine. Reduce the heat to medium-low and set a timer for 10 minutes while you prepare the shrimp. Deshell and devein the shrimp. Once the 10 minutes is up, add the shrimp to the rice mixture and cook for another 8 to 10 minutes, checking to see if the rice is done. Turn the pan occasionally to ensure the mixture cooks evenly.",

        "For a vegetarian option, use vegetable broth and substitute vegan or vegetarian chorizo, which is cooked following package instructions, and added once the rice is finished cooking.",

Beat 6 eggs in a large mixing bowl using a fork or egg beater, and set them aside.",

Cover the pot with a lid and steam the potatoes until they have softened, or about 3 to 4 minutes.

Next, switch the oven broiler on and broil until the top becomes brown and crispy, about 2 to 4 minutes depending on your preference.
