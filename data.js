You will also need 1 oven safe skillet such as a cast iron skillet that is 10 to 12 inches in diameter, 1 chef's knife, 1 large mixing bowl, and a steamer, or optionally, a microwave safe bowl.",

Cover the pot with a lid and steam the potatoes until they have softened, or about 3 to 4 minutes. While you're waiting for the potatoes to steam, go back to the onion and shallot mixture and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook them until they are translucent. This should take about 3 to 4 minutes so they'll finish about the same time as the potatoes.",
          "Take the potatoes out of the steamer and add them to the skillet with the onion and shallot, cook until the potatoes start to brown, stirring occassionally for about 2 minutes. Pour the eggs over the vegetables in the skillet, then garnish the top with green beans.",
