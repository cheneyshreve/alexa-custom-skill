          "The ingredients you will need to collect are 4 potatoes, 6 eggs, 2 teaspoons of salt, 1 teaspoon of pepper, 1 yellow or white onion, 1 shallot, and optionally, about one half cup of green beans. You will also need 1 oven safe skillet such as a cast iron skillet that is 10 to 12 inches in diameter, 1 chef's knife, 1 large mixing bowl, and a steamer, or optionally, a microwave safe bowl.",
          "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Farenheit. Prepare the vegetables by washing the potatoes and green beans, and by removing the skins from the onion and shallot. Then beat 6 eggs in a large mixing bowl and set it aside.",
          "Quarter the potatoes, then thinly slice them. Dice the onion and shallot into small cubes.",
          "Take out the skillet and heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil to medium heat, then add the onion, shallot, salt and pepper. Stir to combine ingredients, then reduce the heat to a simmer. You'll want to keep an eye on these, stirring them occassionally so they cook evenly.",
          "Add about an inch of water to a pot and bring it to a rolling boil. Add the potatoes to the steamer basket and then place it over the pot. Cover the pot with a lid and steam the potatoes until they have softened, or about 3 to 4 minutes. While you're waiting for the potatoes to steam, go back to the onion and shallot mixture and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook them until they are translucent. This should take about 3 to 4 minutes so they'll finish about the same time as the potatoes.",
          "Take the potatoes out of the steamer and add them to the skillet with the onion and shallot, cook until the potatoes start to brown, stirring occassionally for about 2 minutes. Pour the eggs over the vegetables in the skillet, then garnish the top with green beans.",
          "Place the skillet in the top rack of the oven and bake for 10 minutes or until the mixture begins to fluff up. Next, swith the broiler on and broil until the top becomes brown and crispy, about 2 to 4 minutes depending on your preference.",
          "Remove the dish from the oven and let it cool to room temperature in the pan before transferring to a cutting board to cut. Slice and serve!"

        "This recipe is made healthier by steaming the potatoes instead of pan frying them in olive oil and butter, and it also cuts down on the cooking time by about 20 minutes.",
        "The potatoes could be peeled or not for this recipe depending on your preference, you can also substitute golden potatoes with red or white potatoes.",
        "If you don't have a steamer, add the potatoes to a microwave safe bowl, cover them in about an inch of water and heat until they soften, checking in about 2 minute intervals depending on how strong your microwave oven is.",
