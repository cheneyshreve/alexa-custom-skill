# Capstone project

In this project outlines a custom skill for Alexa that is intended to provide an enjoyable cooking experience for users with different skill levels. Examining the reviews of recipe skills in the Alexa store, users are often frustrated by the pace of the recipe being either too fast or too slow, being too detailed, or not detailed enough. This skill will let users pause, repeat and resume and ask for more details following each recipe step. This enables more experienced users or repeat users to go through the recipe skill faster, and less experienced users can hear more details about different cooking techniques and recipe substitutions, going at a slower pace. Users can also get a shopping list and, time permitting, I plan to modify this to reflect different serving sizes and/or recipe substitutions. Ultimately, I'd like to develop a service for food bloggers or other cooking enthusiasts where they can have their recipes made into a skill, and potentially link to new updates on their website through different features such as flash briefing skills, or by other means. I have approximately 80 hours to complete the skill and the website, so I am keeping the design simple, but it something I plan to continue enhancing moving forward.
