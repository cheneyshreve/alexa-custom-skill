# Alexa custom skills project
In this project outlines a custom skill for Alexa that is intended to provide an enjoyable cooking experience for users with different skill levels. Examining the reviews of current skills in the Alexa store, users are often frustrated by the pace of the recipe being either too fast or too slow, being too much or too little detailed, and requiring too many ingredients.

Features of the skill:
- "pause", "repeat", "next", and "previous" keywords for easy navigation
- restart option that persists the user's progress to a database
- connects to several list API's to GET and POST information to the user's household lists within the Alexa app
- card rendering enables users to see text and images in onscreen devices
- user's can ask for "more details" at the end of each instructional step, enabling them to choose a faster or slower path depending on their level of expertise
- recipes minimize ingredients and cooking materials and offer tips for further customizing the recipe, or making substitutions

The second half of this project is creating a blog for a food & travel blogger that supports the following features:
- easy to update
- supports Markdown language
- links to social media throughout site
- enables posting to social media with author's biographic information
- supports high resolution photos and videos


Solution
- customized using a Jekyll template, "Minimal Mistakes", to incorporate the required features into an
easy-to-navigate and update website
- website is currently under 'cheneyshreve.github.io/minimal-mistakes' git-hub pages branch while under development, and will given a custom domain name soon
- as a next step, I'm building a web application using React


## Pre-requisites
